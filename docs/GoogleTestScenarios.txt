Check if you can't claim the same object
A and B are both threads which try to create an accessor and claim the same object.

A: Claim    B: Claim
A: Access   B: Access

Change value of a LockingSharedObject:

Create LockingSharedObject
create SharedObject::Accessor of the LockingSharedObject
Change the value of the LockingSharedObject by accessing the object and assigning a new value using '='

Pass on an Accessor to a thread to test if it can access it:

Create LockingSharedObject
create SharedObject::Accessor of the LockingSharedObject
create thread and pass the accessor to it
thread access the passed Accessor
