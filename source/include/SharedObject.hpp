//! \addtogroup 0005 Shared Objects
//! \brief This project is used to safely share objects between two or more threads.
//!
//! When multiple threads share one object, it is important that they do not
//! access and change the object at the same time. So SharedObjects is a 
//! universal project that can be used throughout R2D2 so everyone uses 
//! the same way to access and lock objects between multiple threads. 
//! Developers do not need to implement their own way to 
//! lock and release objects between threads. 
//! This will reduce duplicated code in multiple projects.
